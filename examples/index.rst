Welcome to AdhUI's documentation!
=================================


The AdhUI package holds all the visualization tools for the AdhModel object (https://github.com/erdc/AdhModel). This package primarily utilizes the PyViz visualization stack which relies heavily on Panel, Holoviews, Geoviews, and Bokeh.

In this package, users will find the individual building blocks for a UI as well as fully constructed dashboards from those building blocks.
